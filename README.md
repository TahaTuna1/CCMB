# CCMB
Currency Converter App for the MacOS menubar. Meant for personal use. Built with SwiftUI.

- The app uses FreeCurrencyAPI. It is limited, but provides an easy way to migrate to the 'proper' currency API. 
- Since the app is not meant to be released, I'm keeping it simple. It only has 20-ish currencies. 
 
# Functional Buttons:
- Refresh: If currencies are changed, it becomes green and allows another network call.
- Info: Shows the latest network call / currency refresh date.
- Theme: Toggles between two themes, blue and red.
- Power: Quits the application.

All currencies can be changed. Only the main currency change triggers a network call. 
This is to keep network call count low. It can easily be changed to constant updates.

- As of 24/04/2023, I'm calling this project finished and moving on to the next one.
